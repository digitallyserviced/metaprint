# Metaprint

Metaprint is a tool that lets you give up on your custom scripts to display your computer infos on softwares like i3 / tmux

## Usage

First, you need to create a config file. It should be located at $HOME/.config/metaprint/config.yml. To find out how module works, checkout the [config reference](#Config)

Then you can call them with the following command:

```sh
$ metaprint <module> <name> [custom args]
# Example:
$ metaprint date tmux
```

## Config

There are not much modules for now, but more will come soon.

Each module can take a prefix and a suffix:
```yml
module_name:
    prefix: 
    suffix: Go
```

### Date
The date module takes a golang date format
```yml
datetime:
  your_custom_name:
    prefix: 
    format: 01/02/06 <b>15:04:05</b>
```

### Ram
The ram module takes a format, a unit and the amount of number after the comma to display.

The format can take multiple params: `%used%`, `%free%`, `%total%`, `%percentage%`, `%percentage_free%`.

The unit can be either `Go`, `Mo`, `Ko`

```yml
ram:
  your_custom_name:
    format: "%used% / %total% %unit%"
    unit: Go
    rounding: 2
```

### IP
The IP module lets you display a local IP address.

It takes an interface array which will be scanned in the same order. As of today, it only supports IPv4. IPv6 support may be coming later (PR are welcome ;)).

It also takes a `no_ip` string that is displayed when no address IP can be found.

```yml
ip:
  your_custom_name:
    interface: ['enp37s0']
    no_ip: No address
```

### Music
The music module accesses the mpris data through dbus so you need a mpris compatible player to go with this (Most of them are: Firefox, Spotify, VLC, ...)

You can limit / order the players allowed the same way you'd do with the IP module, the string required is (@TODO: Find on what I sort and explain how to get it here).

You can put any mpris data as variables, here I only use the title and the artist.

```yml
music:
  tmux:
    format: "%xesam:title% - %xesam:artist%"
    players: ['Mozilla Firefox', 'Spotify'] # Limit to these players, first found is preferred. @TODO Still need to explain how to get those names, IDK
    no_player: none # This is the text displayed when there is no player running
    trim_at: 15 # each variable will be trimmed at 15 chars
    trim_all: 50 # the max response (excluding pre/suffix) will be 50 chars
```

### Full config example
```yml
